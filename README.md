# K-Means Visualiser

Visualise the behaviors of the [K-means clustering algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)
in JavaScript.

You can try this program on [http://jsdo.it/ser1zw/tLeA/fullscreen](http://jsdo.it/ser1zw/tLeA/fullscreen).

This is inspired by [this article](http://tech.nitoyon.com/ja/blog/2009/04/09/kmeans-visualise/)
(ActionScript implementation).


## Requirement
* Some modern web browers that support HTML5.
  * Tested on Google Chrome 22 and Firefox 16.0.2
* (Optional) Some web servers to deploy this program.
  * or just go to [http://jsdo.it/ser1zw/tLeA/fullscreen](http://jsdo.it/ser1zw/tLeA/fullscreen).


## Deployment
Deploy all contents in `src` directory to your web server, and then open `index.html`.

You can also deploy using Python as below:

```
$ cd src
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
